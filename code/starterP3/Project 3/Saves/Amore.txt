:Some more hay:When you've fed your old horse,
but he wants more, of course
:A Jorge:When a George says his name,
Like they say it in Spain
:A toupee:When what's left on your dome
looks like old styrofoam
:A moray:When an eel green as grass,
bites you right on the ass
:A moire:When two patterns combine,
in a way serpentine
:Sycamore:When the moon hits your knees,
and you mispronounce trees
